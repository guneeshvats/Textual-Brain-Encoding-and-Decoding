# Textual-Brain-Encoding-and-Decoding
The brain encoding problem aims to automatically generate fMRI brain representations given a stimulus. The brain decoding problem is the inverse problem of reconstructing the stimuli given the fMRI brain representation. In this task we would be constructing an encoder as well as a decoder for textual stimuli
